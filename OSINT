OSINT Challenge Writeup
I completed all the OSINT challenges. Here's how I solved them:


1. Flight of the Lurk3r
We were given a ZIP file and asked to submit the MD5 hash of the file.
I used a Python script (suggested by ChatGPT) to compute the hash.


  Flag: PAYATU{MD5_HASH}

2. The Lake Below

The ZIP contained a photo taken from inside a plane.
Using Google Reverse Image Search, I found this blog post:

üìé velvetescape.com/plane-view-swiss-alps-lago-maggiore

The name of the lake was in the blog title.

3. The Town at the Edge

We had to name the town on the right side of the river in the image.

The blog mentioned:

    Ascona (right side)

    Locarno (left side)

    Luino (Italy)

    Lugano (top-right)

Since the photo was from Switzerland:

    ‚ùå Locarno (left side) and ‚ùå Luino (Italy) were eliminated

    ‚úÖ Between Ascona and Lugano, Lugano was correct

4. The Flight Code

From the photo:

    KLM was visible on the wing.

    Blog said the flight was from Amsterdam to Milan Malpensa.

    EXIF Metadata gave timestamp:
    15 Oct 2021, 11:40 AM (UTC+2)

I tried replaying traffic on ADSBExchange, but found no match.

The twist: KLM doesn‚Äôt operate to Malpensa anymore, hinting at a "ghost" clue.

After searching KLM flights from Amsterdam to Milan on klm.nl and bruteforcing every flight code, the correct flight was:

5. The Type of Wings

On KLM's website, the flight was listed as a Boeing 737-800.
Wikipedia confirms the aircraft code as B738.

6. The Cryptic Phantom

Using AperiSolve, I extracted EXIF metadata from the photo.
Found a Base64 string in the Author tag ‚Üí decoded to get a username.

7. The Phantom Behind the Lens

Searching for lurk3r_in_p1ane on Google led to an Instagram account.

8. Bonus

Challenge hinted at inspecting a post on the Instagram profile.
In the captions, uppercase letters stood out.
Combining them revealed the hidden message:
